# Image to PDF Converter

This is a Python application that converts a folder of images into a single PDF file. The application uses the `tkinter` library to create a graphical user interface (GUI) for selecting the input and output folders, and for displaying the progress of the conversion process.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the application by executing the `main.py` file.

## Usage

1. Click the "Select Image Folder" button to choose the folder containing the images you want to convert.
2. Click the "Select Output Folder" button to choose the folder where you want to save the PDF file.
3. Click the "Convert to PDF" button to start the conversion process.
4. The progress of the conversion process will be displayed in the progress bar and label.

## Configuration

The application uses a configuration file (`config.ini`) to store the paths of the input and output folders. If the configuration file does not exist, it will be created automatically when the application is run for the first time.
